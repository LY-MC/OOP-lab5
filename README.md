# OOP-lab5

I created a config file where the user can change parameters to affect on simulation. For example, he can change the number of animals, so zookeepers will need to feed more animals, more animals will be ill and, most likely, more customers will be less happy. Also, if he changes the coefficient of happiness for child and adult, so customer will be more or less happy. At which happiness rate customer will leave a tip or the money will be refunded and so on. Most of the decisions in my simulation are based on other events, for example, some animals are hungry, so the zookeeper needs to feed them, but he can feed them with wrong food and the veterinarian needs to treat them, after some hours after feeding, the animal wants to eat again and this circle continues with some insights from simulation.
